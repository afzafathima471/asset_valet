Title : Task-1
Date: 08/02/2026

UNDERSTANDING OF CLIENT REQUIREMENTS:
The client requires a centralized digital system to manage company-owned assets such as laptops, peripherals, etc.The primary point is visibility — knowing exactly which physical item is currently in the possession of which employee, in order to prevent loss and streamline employee offboarding.

CREATIVE FREEDOMS AND SCOPE:
1.Product Name : The product name Asset_Valet was chosen creatively and was not specified by the client.
2.Application Type : A web-based application was chosen so that the software can be accessed on both desktop systems and mobile devices.
3.Scope : The scope was expanded from a simple asset list to a relational asset tracking system that includes asset assignment history logs, rather than only showing current ownership.
4.User Interface : A responsive web user interface was chosen to support both desktop and mobile usage, with built-in QR code scanning via device cameras.

ASSUMPTIONS MADE:
1.It is assumed that the system will be a web-based application requiring active internet connectivity.
2.It is assumed that the client wants a centralized system to manage and track all assets and their assignments to employees.
3.It is assumed that multi-language support is not required in the initial version of the software.
